CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
The term transgender is a relatively new term used to describe an individual who
appears as, wishes to be considered as, or has undergone surgery to become a member of
the opposite sex or gender (American Heritage Dictionary, 2000). According to Reeder
(1996), although many people use the terms sex and gender interchangeably, the two
words have distinct meanings. Sex is a term based on biology and assigned on the basis
of criteria such as chromosomal pattern and genitalia. Gender is socially and
psychologically constructed and used to identify a person's overall presentation, physical
characteristics, inner feelings and behavior, and is based upon society’s classifications of
masculinity or femininity or in certain cases as neither or both of these. According to
Wood (2003), gender is a more complex term than sex; it is acquired and learned through
social interactions and it may change over time. Gender is a relational concept, because
femininity and masculinity exist in relation to each other. As meanings of one gender
change, so do meanings of the other. Generally, sex and gender co-occur so that most
men are primarily masculine and most women are primarily feminine.
In the case of transgender individuals, however, sex and gender are inconsistent.
These individuals believe that they are trapped in the body of one sex but identify
strongly with the other sex (Fausto-Sterling, 2000; Herdt, 1996; Money, 1988). They
believe their biological sex is wrong – that they are really women trapped in men’s
2
bodies or men trapped in women’s bodies (Howey, 2002; Sheridan, 2001; Stryker, 1997,
1998). Transgender people challenge the idea that sex and gender are dualities – that is,
that male and female, masculine and feminine are opposite, stable, and the only two
possibilities (Namaste, 2000).
Other terms that deserve attention are gender identity, gender expression, and
gender dysphoria. According to Andrews (1999), gender identity refers to the internal
psychological belief of an individual as to which of the two gender categories –masculine
or feminine- he or she belongs or ought to belong. A person's gender expression refers to
males expressing their femininity and females expressing their masculinity as well as
females expressing their femininity and males expressing their masculinity. The term
gender expression also refers to how much of an individual’s true gender identity is
revealed to society. Gender dysphoria refers to the discomfort that an individual
experiences with socially and culturally assigned gender roles. Dysphoria is derived
from a Greek word meaning “hard to bear” (Brown & Rounsley, 1996, p.10). Gender
dysphoria is sometimes used as a synonym for transsexualism because it refers to the
discomfort and distress that transgender individuals experience.
The diagnosis of transgenderism was first introduced in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Third Edition - (DSM-III) in 1980 for gender
dysphoric individuals who demonstrated at least two years of continuous interest in
transforming the sex of their bodies and their social gender status (Appendix A).
According to Conway (2002), during this past decade the word transgender has mainly
described all persons whose gender identity differs from what society customarily
3
expects from them. The term transgender, therefore, includes among others, people who
are called or who call themselves transsexuals, transvestites and crossdressers (Appendix
B).
This study will focus on male-to-female transgender individuals. Although these
individuals comprise a small group of the population, the number is increasing steadily.
The prevalence of the male-to-female transgender persons is currently at a ratio of 1:1500
adult males or more (Conway, 2002). According to experts in sexual and gender identity
disorders mentioned in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -Fourth
Edition - (DSM-IV) (2000), there are no recent epidemiological studies to provide data
on prevalence of Gender Identity Disorder. Data from smaller countries in Europe with
access to total population statistics and referrals suggest that roughly 1 in 30,000
(1:30,000) adult males and 1 per 100,000 (1:100,000) adult females seek sexreassignment
surgery (SRS). According to Conway (2002), these estimations seem
extremely low when at present 800-1000 Male-to-Female SRS operations are performed
in the U. S. each year, and many or more are performed on U.S. citizens abroad. Thus,
approximately 1500 to 2000 Male-to-Female SRSs are completed per year on U.S.
citizens and residents.
As the prevalence of transgender individuals increases, so does the need for
professionals who can treat these individuals. Such professionals may include medical
personnel, psychologists, counselors, speech-language pathologists, social workers, and
others. According to Freidenberg (2002), transgender individuals increasingly represent
a small percentage of the caseload of speech-language pathologists with a specialty in
4
voice disorders. Unfortunately very little research exists on the male-to-female
transgender voice. A few studies have evaluated acoustic and perceptual measures of the
male-to-female transgender voice (Bralley, Bull, Gore, & Edgerton, 1978; Challoner
1986; Spencer 1988; Wolfe, Ratusnik, Smith, & Northrop, 1990; Gunzburger 1995;
Oates & Dakakis, 1997; Gelfer & Schofield, 2000). Even fewer studies (Kalra 1977;
Hooper 1985; Mount & Salmon, 1988; Gelfer 1999; De Bruin, Coerts, & Greven, 2000)
report beneficial effects of voice therapy on the male-to-female transgender voice.
Currently, there is no research to suggest the use of specific voice therapy
approaches in combination with singing exercises and/or Melodic Intonation Therapy
(MIT) for male-to-female individuals. This study will focus on the benefits of voice
therapy on the male-to-female transgender voice when combined with singing
interventions as well as MIT. Singing exercises in combination with MIT should help
create a more musical and thus, a more feminine sounding voice. Andrews (1999)
suggests that for male-to-female individuals seeking voice therapy, pitch level is actually
less important than pitch variability or the musicality of the voice pattern. MIT primarily
involves speaking in an intoned manner while singing involves great pitch variability as
well as a legato vocal pattern and increased duration of some vowels. According to
speculations made by experts, these musical parameters may be helpful in establishing a
feminine sounding voice.
I. Objective and Specific Aims
The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of traditional voice therapy
approaches in combination with specific singing exercises as well as Melodic Intonation
5
Therapy (MIT) in an attempt to aid male-to-female transgender individuals in producing
a more feminine sounding voice. To achieve this objective, the specific aims of the study
were the following:
1. To quantify the effects of traditional voice therapy on obtained voice evaluation
measures in male-to-female individuals (Group 1) and compare those results with
the effects of traditional voice therapy in combination with singing exercises and
MIT interventions on obtained voice evaluation measures in male-to-female
individuals (Group 2).
1. To assess the efficacy of traditional voice therapy on participants’ perceptions of a
feminine sounding voice pre- and post- training (Group 1) and compare those
results with participants’ perceptions receiving traditional voice therapy in
combination with singing exercises and MIT pre- and post- training (Group 2).
1. To assess the efficacy of traditional voice therapy on listeners’ perceptions
regarding a feminine vs. a masculine sounding voice pre- and post- training and
compare those results with listeners’ perceptions regarding a feminine vs. a
masculine sounding voice of participants receiving traditional voice therapy in
combination with singing exercises and MIT pre- and post- training.
II. Research Questions
Two main research questions were posed in this study:
1. Based on objective and subjective measures, does traditional voice therapy
increase the degree of femininity in male-to-female transgender speakers?
6
1. Based on objective and subjective measures, does the inclusion of singing
exercises and Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) further increase the degree of
femininity in male-to-female transgender speakers?
III. Assumptions
Several assumptions have been made about the specific therapy approaches used in
this study:
1. All of the participants will be able to provide the examiner with reliable selfperceptions
regarding their voice, during pre- and post- training. This information
will be documented via individual interviews that will occur pre- and posttraining.
1. All of the participants will be able to learn and maintain the new voice therapy
techniques taught during a consecutive 12-week period.
1. All of the participants will be able to practice the specific vocal techniques at
home in order to learn and be able to adapt to their new feminine sounding voice.
1. The examiner will be able to effectively teach the new vocal techniques and
behaviors to all participants during the 12-week therapy period.
1. No major differences exist between male-to-female transgender participants
receiving group voice therapy and male-to-female transgender participants
receiving individual voice therapy. This particular information has not been
researched and, thus, is currently unavailable.
7
1. No major quantitative and/or qualitative differences exist between voice measures
during reading and voice measures during conversation. The particular
information has not been researched and, thus, is currently unavailable.
IV. Limitations
The small sample size is a limitation. The principal investigator will recruit
participants from a transgender support group and by word of mouth. Some transgender
individuals may not seek voice therapy because of the unique nature of their voice
disorders, for example, they may feel embarrassed or think that their vocal characteristics
are so masculine that they may be extremely difficult to change. This limitation may
decrease the sample size of the study and thus decrease the study’s power (Howell,
2004).

CHAPTER II
REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
I. Transgender Voice
According to Boone (2000) in female-to-male transgender persons, a lower pitch
can be usually achieved through hormonal therapy; testosterone has the effect of
thickening the vocal folds and thus, lowering vocal pitch. The female-to-male
individuals, therefore, rarely require the services of a speech-language pathologist.
Professionals who work with male-to-female transgender clients, and the clients
themselves, report that changing the speech (including voice) and language
characteristics prove to be the most problematic masculine characteristics and the ones in
need of professional help (Hooper, 2000). For most clients the most important initial
treatment goal is to raise speaking fundamental frequency quite markedly (Gelfer, 1999).
According to Boone (1997), pitch is a key element of one’s voice “fingerprint,” one of
the characteristics that makes one’s voice distinctively unique. Even without visual cues,
voice pitch helps to immediately identify whether the speaker is male or female.
Although many transgender individuals indicate that changing their pitch level is their
most important goal, the pitch level is actually less important than is pitch variability or
the musicality of the voice pattern (Andrews, 1999).
9
1. Pitch and Pitch Variability
Early clinicians and researchers in gender/voice change reported selecting target
Speaking Fundamental Frequencies (SFFs) for their male-to-female clients of
approximately 200 Hz (Kalra, 1977; Bralley, Bull, Gore, & Edgerton, 1978; Mount and
Salmon, 1988). It should be noted that most of this literature was based on single
subjects engaged in treatment programs. More extensive research of transgender voice
(Gelfer & Schofield, Spencer, 1988; Wolfe, Ratusnik, Smith, & Northrop, 1990)
consistently has indicated that an individual’s SFF must be at least 160-165 Hz or higher
for the voice to be identified as belonging to a female. For Wolfe et al. (1990) and Gelfer
and Schofield (2000), the mean SFFs of female-perceived transgender individuals were
172 Hz and 187 Hz, respectively, with the higher SFFs in both studies approximating 200
Hz. SFFs below 165 Hz were consistently identified as male voices. Studies that have
investigated listeners’ perceptual judgments of average pitch support these acoustic
findings; voices identified as female are consistently higher than those identified as male
(Oates and Dacakis, 1997). Table 1, developed by Oates and Dacakis (1997),
summarizes typical fundamental frequencies and overlap between males and females.
Table 1. Frequency range overlap for males and females (Oates and Dacakis, 1997).
Gender Typical Fundamental
Frequency
(In Hertz)
Mean Fundamental Frequency
(In Hertz)
Male 80-165 Hz 107-132 Hz
Female 145-275 Hz 196-224 Hz
Gender Ambiguous Range 145-165 Hz
10
In a recent study involving listener judgments, Gelfer and Schofield (2000)
obtained somewhat different results than those shown in Table 1. They found that some
speakers with a speaking fundamental frequency (SFF) greater than 170 Hz were still
perceived as male speakers. The mean SFF for Gelfer and Schofield’s group of femaleperceived
speakers was 187 Hz, with speakers’ SFFs ranging from 164 Hz to 199 Hz.
Interestingly, there was some unexpected overlap between some of the male-rated
speakers and the female-rated speakers in the range of 164 Hz to 181 Hz. Once again,
speakers with a higher SFF were more likely to be perceived as female.
Oates and Dacakis (1997) noted that when frequency range and standard
deviation were measured in Hertz, females were found to use a wider pitch range and
pitch variability than males. Also, women’s voices were judged as more “expressive”
and “melodious” than men’s voices. Oates and Dacakis (1997) reported that other studies
reached similar conclusions. According to Pellowe and Jones (1978), women use greater
intonational variability as well as more patterns of rising tones, whereas men use a higher
proportion of falling tones.
2. Resonance
The American Heritage Dictionary (2000) defines resonance, in its acoustic sense,
as the intensification and prolongation of sound, especially of a musical tone, produced
by sympathetic vibration. Spencer (1988) and Gelfer & Schofield (2000) noted that
resonance is among the most important parameters in gender identification. According to
Oates and Dacakis (1997), resonance differences between male and female voices have
been demonstrated consistently. Average formant frequencies of women’s voices are
11
approximately 20% higher than those of males (p.179). This quality is usually attributed
to the comparatively shorter vocal tracts of women (Hirano, Kurita, & Nakahima, 1983).
According to Andrews (1999), many genetic women have low-pitched, although
feminine-sounding voices. This is a result of resonance and of women’s small resonating
cavities. Morrison and Rammage (1994) note that the length and shape of the vocal tract
influence formant frequencies. Therefore, some men, trying to sound like women, may
consciously try to shorten vocal tract length by raising the larynx.
Markus (2003) suggests that using a head voice/vocal register is required for a
natural-sounding feminine voice. Table 2 presents the four vocal registers and their
relationship to muscles used, parts of vocal folds in vibration, pitch quality, and pitch.
Table 2. Vocal Registers – Muscles Used, Parts of Folds in Vibration, Quality
Produced, and Pitch Level (Web site of National Center for Voice and Speech:
http://www.ncvs.org )

Use of falsetto voice/register should be discouraged (Andrews, 1999). Use of the
falsetto voice/register may be perceived as being a weak, effeminate, and fake feminine
voice.
Appendix C shows some of the main anatomical terminology used for voice
production.
3. Loudness, Durational Characteristics, and Phrasing
Gelfer and Young (1997) suggest that men use a higher conversational intensity
level than women. According to Andrews (1999), most men attempting to use feminine
speech markers must learn to use softer vocal onsets while speaking, a less forceful style,
a linking of words that suggests a legato rather than a staccato pattern, and increased
duration of some vowels (e.g., “so gorgeous”).
4. Breathiness
According to Klatt, & Klatt (1990) and Sulter, & Peters (1996) female voices are
perceived as breathy more often than male voices. Research suggests that some women
speak with incomplete closure of the vocal folds, which produces breathiness and which
is viewed as normal for women, but far less likely to occur in men (Biever, & Bless,
1989; Sodersten, Hertegard, & Hammarberg, 1995).
5. Articulation
According to Andrews (1999) “women seem to open their mouths more than men
and to articulate more clearly. However, they do not make hard articulatory contacts or
punch out their words” (p.442).
13
6. Language Structures and Vocabulary
There are many differences in the way men and women use language to meet their
needs and to interact socially with peers. Tannen (1992) states that men communicate as
a means of establishing a place in the hierarchy and in order to acquire information,
whereas women try to build consensus and share thoughts and feelings. According to
Andrews (1999), women in our culture use the following when speaking: more tag
questions (It’s warm today, isn’t it?), tentative language (I think I may go with you),
inclusive pronouns (Our opinions may make a difference or We need to talk about this),
increased elaboration, qualifiers, and disclaimers as well as increased use of adverbs,
adjectives (It was a wonderful recital or She is so beautiful and so stylish!), and socially
polite words/apologies and questions.
In her dissertation “The Socio-Linguistic Construction of Gender and Gender
Relationships in a University Community,” Remlinger suggests that men are less likely to
ask questions in a public situation because doing so will reveal their lack of knowledge.
Of course, this data does not suggest that all men will not ask questions when they are in
doubt, nor that all women will; the differences are a matter of likelihood and degree.
Research by Wolfson (1984) and Holmes (1989) suggests that women offer more
compliments than men do and that women offer them more often to other women than to
men. According to Tannen (2001), “compliments are a conventionalized form of praise,
and exchanging compliments is a form of ritual, especially for many women” (p. 68).
Many authors (Zimmernam & West, 1975; Eakins & Eakins, 1976; McMillan,
Clifton, McGrath, & Gale, 1977; Esposito, 1979; Bohn & Stutman, 1983) report that
14
males generally interrupt females more than females interrupt males during conversation.
Zimmerman and West (1975) define an interruption as a violation of the turn exchange
system and thus, as a device for exercising power and control in conversation. Esposito
(1979) assigned 40 preschool children to play groups and found that boys interrupted
girls twice as often as girls interrupted boys. While examining the speech of 16 mothers
and 16 fathers, Gleason and Greif, (1983) found that fathers interrupt their children more
than mothers, and that both interrupt female children more than male children.
Vocabulary differences should also be addressed. Andrews (1999) suggests that there
seem to be some terms (e.g., underwear vs. lingerie) that differ significantly, depending
on whether men or women are speaking.
7. Nonverbal Communication
Nonverbal communication includes every component of communication other
than words. It generally includes the following parameters: listening/attending behaviors
such as eye contact and head nodding, hand gestures, smiling, crying, body posture and
body positioning, touching, and so on.
Hirsh (2003) reports her ideas of gender differences in nonverbal communication.
Such differences include the following speculations:
• Women tend to express their emotions more openly (e.g., laughing, crying).
• Women tend to exhibit more listening/attending behaviors during conversation
(e.g., eye contact and head nodding).
• Women tend to use more gestures and movements to emphasize their statements.
15
• Women tend to touch themselves (e.g., playing with a necklace, tugging at
earrings, playing with their hair).
• Women also tend to touch their conversational partners to express support,
affection, agreement, and comfort.
• Women tend to move their heads while speaking and while listening to their
conversational partner.
• Women tend to sit more closely to their conversational partners.
• Women tend to use a wide range of facial expressions to convey their emotions.
• Women tend to stand in an “S-Shape” figure (the body is shaped as an “S” letter)
while men tend to stand in an “A-Shape” figure (the body is shaped as an “A”
letter).
Results of a research study conducted by Astrom, Thorell, and d’ Elia (1993)
showed that females consider face communication (e.g., eye contact and smile) to be the
most important aspect of nonverbal communication. According to Epps (1989), females
are more “accommodating” than males in their decoding of unintended, unconscious, or
deceptive cues.
II. Speech and Singing - A Comparison
Acoustically, singing and speech are fundamentally similar. Both use sound and
are, therefore, received and analyzed by the same organs. Both music and speech are
forms of expression, and music is often referred to as a nonverbal means of
communication (Hoskins, 1988). Although many of their acoustical features are similar,
16
they are used in different ways. Music/singing is closely related in human beings to
speech and language, both neurologically and developmentally (Michel & Jones, 1991).
Infants in the womb react both to unstructured noise and to music with
movements that their mothers can feel (Storr, 1992). It seems that the origins of both
music and language lie in the connection between the neural development of the fetus and
this early sound environment (Callaghan, 2000). After birth, the affective expressions of
crooning, cooing, and babbling develop into speech and song (Storr, 1992), with the
distinction between speech and song often unclear (Welch, 1994). Brody (1949) suggests
that infants tend to experiment with vocalizations and sounds that are mostly of a singing
nature. As speech develops, the vocal experimentation may dwindle due to the need to
focus on learning meaningful speech sounds (Kessen, Levine & Wendrich, 1979;
Wendrich, 1981; Fox, 1983, Sinor, 1984; Trollinger, 1994).
Some writers theorize that music and speech develop in a parallel fashion from
adjacent areas of the brain, and differentiate into what are called speech language and
music language (Boyle & Radocy, 1979). According to Gfeller (1990), obvious parallels
and differences exist between speech and music in terms of syntax, semantics, and social
context. As part of the same developmental sequence, the two are complimentary and
may reciprocate in many ways. Singing, however, is different from speech in that it is a
more varied form of communication having a wider variety of pitches, rhythms, and form
patterns.
According to Trollinger (2001), perceived variation in pitch is a characteristic of
connected speech as well as singing, although the pitch of one’s speaking voice is not as
17
consciously controlled as the pitch variables in the singing voice. The relationship
between singing and speech production has historically been viewed as a way for orators
to learn vocal expressiveness (Quintilian in Mark, 1994). According to Sundberg (1987),
“Many actors study singing to improve vocal expressiveness, as insight to a character’s
emotional state can be heard in the pitch contour, duration of the various syllables, and
other aspects of speech” (p.148).
Andrews (1999) suggests that voice production is a multisystem activity that
involves integration and coordination of the movements of different structures.
According to Trollinger (2001), the functions of this system for speech and song have
been investigated separately by a number of researchers. However, very little research
exists regarding the relationship of the sounds of speech as they relate to the sounds for
singing. In Literacy Style and Music, Spencer (1950) wrote that there is a relationship
between speech and music expressed through singing. Spencer also suggests that there is
a relationship between the native language and the ability to sing, although he
acknowledges that there is not “much direct evidence in support of his conclusion.”
Spencer states:
May we not say, for instance, that the Italians, among whom modern music was
earliest cultivated, and who have more especially excelled in melody - may we
not say that these Italians speak in more varied and expressive inflections and
cadences than any other people? On the other hand, may we not say that,
confined almost exclusively as they have hitherto been to their national airs, and
therefore accustomed to but a limited range of musical expression, the Scotch are
unusually monotonous in the intervals and modulations of their speech? (Spencer,
pp. 72-73).
18
The ability to sing has been described in many ways, ranging from it being a
cultural necessity to it being a discrete talent that only a few posses (Trollinger, 2001).
Anecdotal evidence suggests that some adults sing easily and beautifully while others
find that just trying to match pitch or sing a simple tune is difficult. A number of
researchers (Hattwick, 1933; Drexler, 1938; Jersild & Bienstock, 1931, 1934; Harkey,
1979; Sinor, 1984; Ries, 1987; Brown, 1988; Flowers & Dunne-Sousa, 1990) have found
that the ability to discriminate between the skills needed for singing and speech may
arrive at a critical stage of development during or after language onset. Trollinger (2001)
hypothesizes that humans may be born with the ability to sing; however, unless this skill
is exercised both cognitively and physically, it may cease to exist.
III. Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT)
Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) is a therapy technique that was developed by
Sparks and Holland (1974) and further developed by Helm-Estabrooks and Naeser
(1985). Melodic Intonation Therapy is described by Sparks and Holland (1976) as a
method to aid adults with severe aphasia in recovery of the ability to encode thoughts into
units of meaningful verbal communication. According to Square and Martin (1994) MIT
is an approach that helps adults with aphasia re-establish an underlying melody and rate
for speech production as well as produce simplistic and fully syntactic utterances. Even
though the original intention for developing MIT was to assist aphasic patients in
regaining some of their ability to use language, some clinicians are using the technique as
a phonological intervention for clients with verbal apraxia and foreign accent reduction.
The use of MIT with these clients may be justified since research shows that an
19
unimpaired right cerebral hemisphere is dominant for music and that it controls prosody
of speech (Sparks et al., 1974).
The therapeutic benefits of MIT for aphasic patients with good comprehension
but minimal speech output were first reported by Albert, Sparks and Helm (1973) in a
preliminary report. In the three cases reported, MIT treatment resulted in increased
spontaneous verbal output in the natural environment. One patient required only two
weeks of treatment to progress from the use of six repetitive phonemes to full responses
that were grammatically correct in his natural environment. The other two patients
required approximately 1 to 1.5 months of treatment in order to progress from
meaningless grunts and stereotyped phonemes to participation in short but meaningful
conversations. In a second report (Sparks, Helm, & Albert, 1974), a physiological model
was presented that would account for MIT success in terms of right cerebral hemisphere
dominance for music and speech prosody. Several other reports, however, found that
MIT was not effective as measured by improved language test scores for some nonfluent
aphasic patients (Sparks at al., 1974; Helm, 1979). In an attempt to provide clearer
guidelines for use of MIT, Naeser and Helm-Estabrooks (1985) undertook a study that
examined site of lesion correlated with improved ‘language’ test scores as derived from
the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) (Goodglass and Kaplan, 1972)
following MIT treatment of eight patients who had also received Computed Tomography
(CT) scans. MIT proved to be a successful treatment method for the patients who had no
damage in the Wernicke’s area of the brain.
20
1. The Form of MIT
MIT involves combining short phrases with rhythmic and melodic patterns that
imitate normal speech inflections. According to Luria, (1970); Rosenbek and LaPointe,
(1978; 1985;) and Rosenbeck et al. (1976), MIT consists primarily of hand gestures
coupled with word production of ‘intoned’ rather than spoken speech. Meaningful
phrases such as ‘I want coffee’ and ‘Go to bed’ are often produced clearly after a patient
has successfully completed the various steps of the MIT approach. Treatment occurs in
three stages: unison speech with melodic patterns, imitative speech with melodic patterns,
and imitative speech without melody.
2. A Comparison of MIT with Singing and Speech
Melodic Intonation Therapy involves singing. It is similar to singing in that it
incorporates melody, rhythm, and stress. Sparks and Holland (1976) briefly describe the
difference between MIT and songs. Specifically, songs have distinct melodies. In
contrast, MIT is based on the spoken prosody of verbal utterances. MIT uses a vocal
range that is limited to three or four whole steps. This limited range of sung pitches is
comfortable for the untrained voice of adults. MIT is based on three elements of spoken
prosody: The melodic line or variation of pitch in the spoken phrase or sentence, the
tempo and rhythm of the utterance, and points of stress in the phrase. Some exaggeration
of the three elements of a spoken prosody model occurs when the utterance is intoned.
First, the tempo is lengthened to a more lyrical utterance. Second, the constantly varying
pitch of speech is reduced and stylized into a melodic pattern involving the constant pitch
of several whole steps. Third, the rhythm and degree of stress for purposes of emphasis
21
is exaggerated, something that usually involves increased loudness and elevation of sung
notes. These three modifications of spoken prosody serve as a means of emphasizing the
prosodic structure of the utterance.
According to Miller (1994), MIT relates to speech and is much like chanting;
however, it uses a slower and more lyrical tempo than speech with more precise rhythm
and more accentuated points of stress. Intonation patterns that resemble those of wellknown
songs should be avoided, since regression to the words of the songs may occur if
such melodies are used. Since there are several alternate prosody patterns for any
utterance, the clinician must exercise her/his own judgment as to which one will be used
for a phrase/sentence.
3. The Hierarchy of MIT
MIT involves four main levels. Level I, which has no linguistic component,
establishes the process of intoning melody patterns and accurately hand-tapping the
rhythm and stress of each pattern. During Level II, the client is asked to respond to a
request from the clinician for a repetition of the target sentence. In Level III, difficulty is
increased by fading participation of the clinician, by introducing enforced delay of
responses so that some element of retrieval is introduced, and by requiring the client to
give appropriate intoned responses to intoned questions from the clinician regarding
elements of information in the sentences. Finally, during Level IV, there is return to
normal speech prosody. Transition back to speech prosody is facilitated by a technique
called sprechgesang (speech-song).
22
CHAPTER III
METHODS
I. Participants
Male-to-female transgender persons experience feminizing effects from taking
estrogen, such as breast enlargement and some softening of muscle definition; however,
there are no feminizing effects on the vocal folds and thus, pitch level remains at adult
male levels. It would appear that some forms of vocal fold surgery, such as longitudinal
incision of vocal folds or some form of thyroplasty could enable a higher-pitched voice
(Blaugrund, Isshiki, and Taira, 1992). Unfortunately, even after surgical intervention, the
male-to-female transgender person may still experience vocal dissatisfaction and thus,
profit from voice therapy. This is not to say that all transgender individuals undergo
surgery or take estrogen. There are many who simply desire to sound more feminine in
order to match their voice with their feminine appearance. These individuals are also in
need of the services of speech-language pathologists.
Participants for this study were recruited from a transgender support group in
Greensboro, North Carolina, and by word of mouth. Six male-to female individuals,
ranging in age from 37 to 63 years, volunteered to participate in the study. Participants
were US citizens and used English as their first language. Participant data is located in
Table 3.

Participants were randomly divided into two groups: Three individuals
(participants #1, #2, and #3) received traditional voice therapy plus feminine language
structures/vocabulary and nonverbal communication (Group 1), while the remaining three
individuals (participants #4, #5, and #6) received traditional voice therapy plus singing
exercises and Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) – (Group 2). Participants were
randomly chosen for these groups. All participants received traditional voice therapy
techniques in a group setting. These techniques included: use of appropriate body
posture, diaphragmatic breathing, voice journal, pitch and pitch variability exercises,
vowel prolongation exercises, legato phrasing exercises, breathiness exercises, and
24
resonance exercises. Sessions lasted for 60 minutes. Groups 1 and 2 both received 45
minutes of traditional voice therapy interventions. In Group 1, participants received
feminine language structures/vocabulary and nonverbal communication for the remaining
15 minutes in order to establish equal amounts of time of receiving traditional voice
therapy as in Group 2. In Group 2, participants received singing exercises and MIT for
the remaining 15 minutes. Figures 1 illustrates the division of time during therapy for
Group 1 and Group 2. Table 4 shows the therapy approaches used with each group.

II. Equipment and Materials
Data was recorded by audio-recordings, videotapes, and written records. All
group sessions were audio- and videotaped. Data gathering tools also included the CSL
(Kay Elemetrics) (Computerized Speech Lab), a self-calibrating PC-based speech and
signal processing system that contains a broad range of voice analysis tools and is used
for speech analysis in research and clinical settings. Fundamental frequency during
reading and conversation was obtained by use of the CSL.
III. Procedures
1. Pretest
A pretest was given to all participants to identify the baseline for the study. All
testing was conducted in the Applied Communication Sciences Lab in Ferguson Building
at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and took approximately 45-60 minutes.
The pretest included the following components for each participant:
• Permission – Prior to any testing, all participants were informed of their rights by
way of a brief oral presentation by the principal investigator and a participant
consent form was signed before testing began. All participants were assigned
individual numbers to protect their privacy so that they would not be identified by
name in this study.
• Interview – During a brief interview, the principal investigator asked each
participant a series of questions related to their transition process, social
experiences and support, vocal characteristics, and goals for voice therapy. Most
27
of the questions used for the interview were taken from Andrews (1999)
(Appendix D).
• Voice Evaluation – The voice evaluation (Appendix E) included the following
measures for each participant:
 Fundamental frequency during reading – Refers to the frequency
(measured in Hertz) that an individual habitually uses during
reading. The participants were asked to read a standard text
passage (e.g., The “Rainbow Passage”),
 Fundamental frequency during conversation – Refers to the
frequency (measured in Hertz) that an individual habitually uses
during conversation. The participants were asked to converse for
1-2 minutes with the principal investigator, and fundamental
frequency was measured by the principal investigator.
IV. Therapy Approach
Following the pretest, participants were randomly divided into two groups. Both
groups received twelve weeks of voice therapy for 60 minutes, once a week, with the
principal investigator, to improve vocal behaviors or communication patterns identified
and perceived during the pretest as more masculine than feminine. Group 1 received
traditional voice therapy only while Group 2 received traditional voice therapy in
combination with singing exercises and Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT). Appendix F
shows the suggested organization of weekly sessions for twelve consecutive weeks. The
12-week duration and general organization of the sessions was adapted from Mordaunt
28
(2003). All therapy techniques were the same for both Groups; however, Group 1
received 15 minutes of instruction in feminine language structures and nonverbal
communication techniques while Group 2 received additional Melodic Intonation
Therapy (MIT) and singing exercises for 15 minutes. Each session was designed in order
to meet the following goals:
• Good vocal hygiene
• Good body posture
• Appropriate use of diaphragmatic breathing
• Appropriate pitch level and pitch variability
• Appropriate resonance
• Appropriate vowel prolongations
• Appropriate phrasing/legato speech
• Appropriate vocal onsets, breathiness, and loudness levels
During the second week of the therapy sessions, anatomy and physiology of the vocal
mechanism were briefly introduced by the principal investigator, with the aid of pictures
and diagrams from Blue Tree Publishing, Inc.
1. Singing Exercises
Singing exercises (Appendix G) were included in each session for participants in
Group 2. These exercises help establish focus, proper breathing habits, and physical
readiness for singing (Robinson & Althouse, 1997).
In her study “The Effect of Singing Instruction upon the Speech Production of
Neurologically Impaired Persons,” Cohen (1991) found that the treatment group showed
29
significant improvements in speaking fundamental frequency variability. According to
Oliveira Barrichelo, Heuer, Dean, & Sataloff (2001), singing training has a positive effect
on the resonance of the speaking voice. Their research suggests that singers show more
energy concentration in the singer’s formant/speaker’s ring region in both sung and
spoken vowels. Results from another study support the view that fundamental frequency
is monitored better in singing than in the speaking voice where it is mainly controlled
supra-segmentally (Natke, Donath, & Kalveram, 2003).
2. Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) Exercises
Melodic Intonation Exercises (Appendix H) were also included in each session for
participants in Group 2. Following the guidelines suggested mainly by Sparks, &
Holland (1976), these exercises were designed by the principal investigator to assist the
participants in developing better pitch variability while speaking. These
exercises/utterances were first sung by the principal investigator, then by the participants,
and finally they were spoken with exaggerated pitch variability by the participants.
3. Voice Journal
All participants were required to keep a weekly voice journal, which was
provided by the investigator at the beginning of therapy (Appendix I). In the journal,
participants kept written records of all information relevant to their voice progress,
therapy experiences, observations, and comments.
V. Therapy Techniques
The following therapy techniques and exercises were used with all participants.
30
1. Vocal Hygiene Recommendations
Each participant was guided by the principal investigator through some general
vocal hygiene recommendations (Swartz, 2004). These include the following:
• Increase hydration and humidification,
• Reduce/eliminate caffeine, smoking, and alcohol consumption,
• Identify medications that may have side effects including hoarseness and/or
cough,
• Assess environment for airborne irritants and wear a mask if necessary,
• Reduce exposure to allergens,
• Assess acoustic properties of a room and modify as needed,
• Use amplification during periods of extended voice use,
• Avoid excessive talking, screaming, and yelling, and
• Avoid talking while stressed, tired, or when you have a cold/upper respiratory
infection.
2. Posture
Each participant was guided by the principal investigator in establishing good
body posture. Good vocal production is dependent upon proper posture. The vocal
mechanism works optimally when the head, neck, and back are well aligned, as if an
imaginary line were passing through the center of the body from the crown of the head to
the floor. Good body posture was accomplished by emphasizing the following points:
• The crown of the head should be the highest point,
• The head should be loose and centered on the shoulders,
31
• The chin should be at a 90 degree angle with the neck,
• The chest cavity and the back should be expanded,
• The arms should hang loose and the hands should fall in front of the thighs,
• The pelvis should be tilted and the lower back should be relaxed,
• The knees should be unlocked,
• The body weight should be evenly distributed on the heels and soles,
• The feet should be apart for balance.
3. Diaphragmatic Breathing
Each participant was given a description of the diaphragmatic breathing process,
followed by a series of breathing exercises (Appendix J).
4. Pitch and Pitch Variability Exercises
Each participant was guided by the principal investigator in establishing
appropriate pitch level and pitch variability by using the Real Time Pitch program on the
CSL (Kay Elemetrics) as well as Gelfer’s Steps in Voice Therapy for Transgender
Clients (Appendix K).
5. Vowel Prolongation Exercises
Each participant was instructed through vowel prolongation exercises. According
to Andrews, 1999, some women tend to use an increased duration of some vowels (e.g.,
“So gorgeous”). Appendix L demonstrates some of the utterances used for this exercise.
The underlined vowels represent the vowels that should be prolonged.
32
6. Legato Phrasing Exercises
Each participant was instructed through legato phrasing exercises. According to
Andrews (1999), some women tend to use a linking of words that suggests a legato rather
than a staccato pattern. Appendix M shows some of the words and sentences used for
these exercises (Andrews, 1999).
7. Breathiness Exercises
Each participant was instructed through exercises to increase breathiness.
Research shows that some women speak with an incomplete closure of the vocal folds,
something which is viewed as normal for women, but far less likely to occur in men
(Biever and Bless, 1989; Sodersten, Hertegard, and Hammarberg, 1995). According to
Klatt, and Klatt (1990) and Sulter and Peters (1996) female voices are perceived as
breathy more often than male voices. Appendix I, N includes some of the words and
sentences used for this exercise.
8. Resonance Exercises
Each participant was guided by the principal investigator in establishing
appropriate “frontal focus” sensations. Frontal focus refers to the resonation of the voice
in the supraglottic cavities. Appendix O includes some of the exercises used with each
participant to improve frontal focus.
9. Language Structures and Vocabulary Exercises
Participants in Group 1 were instructed by the principal investigator during group
conversations to use feminine language structures and vocabulary (see Appendix P) such
as: increased use of questions and especially tag questions, tentative language, inclusive
33
pronouns, qualifiers, and disclaimers, as well as increased use of adverbs, adjectives,
socially polite words/apologies, and elaboration. Each participant was also instructed to
use vocabulary that is more often used by women than by men. Such vocabulary may
include the following words: wonderful, sweet, lovely, and elegant. Most of the
examples from Appendix P were taken from Tannen (1992).
10. Nonverbal Communication Exercises
Participants in Group 1 were instructed through nonverbal communication
exercises as part of the holistic voice therapy approach adopted by the principal
investigator. These exercises (see Appendix Q) included focusing on body and head
movements, hand gestures, eye contact and facial expressions. Most of the examples
from Appendix Q were taken from Hirsh (2003).
VI. Posttest
A posttest was given twelve weeks after the first session of voice therapy. The
purpose of the posttest was to determine generalization and carryover of the new vocal
characteristics and communication patterns learned during the therapy sessions. All
testing was conducted in the Applied Communication Sciences Lab in Ferguson Building
at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and lasted for approximately 45-60
minutes. The posttest included the following components for each participant:
1. Interview – During a brief interview, the principal investigator asked each
participant a series of questions related to their voice therapy experiences
(Appendix R).
34
1. Voice Evaluation – A voice evaluation (as stated above in the pretest section) was
completed for all participants during the last voice therapy session.
VII. Reliability
All data was recorded by the principal investigator at the time of testing. Audio
recordings were made of a reading passage (“The Rainbow Passage”) for each participant
for perceptual analysis by the study’s judges. Data was judged by two first-year speechlanguage
pathology graduate students and by two non-trained volunteers. The judges
were asked to rate voice quality on a 1-7 rating scale, 1 being a very masculine sounding
voice and 7 being a very feminine sounding voice. Audio recordings of the participants’
voices pre- and post- therapy were randomly played along with a few recordings of
biological males and females. The perceptual judgments were compared with the
judgments of the principal investigator and only those in which there was a 75% (3 out of
4 judges) or above agreement and the results were within 1 point difference were used for
data analysis.
VIII. Data Analysis
Results for each participant for the Voice Evaluation, and the
qualitative/perceptual judgments made about participants’ voice quality (1-7 rating scale)
from the four judges as well as the participants themselves were analyzed as single case
studies. Differences in qualitative/perceptual judgments made by the four judges and
participants themselves will be discussed in each case study. Differences in quantitative
measures from the voice evaluation (fundamental frequency during reading and
35
conversation, and pitch range) before and after treatment will also be discussed by the
principal investigator for each case study. Selected information and comments from each
participant’s voice journal as well as posttest interviews will also be included. All results
for each participant will be displayed in a table.
36
CHAPTER IV
RESULTS
Due to the small sample size (n=6) of this study, data analysis consisted primarily
of descriptive analysis. Data regarding Maximum Phonation Range (MPR) was not
obtained during this study due to a computer malfunction and, therefore, will not be
included. In this section, quantitative results are presented in addition to case studies for
each individual participant.
Quantitative Results – Speaking Fundamental Frequencies (SFFs)
At the beginning of the study, five (83%) out of the six participants presented
with speaking fundamental frequencies (SFFs) below the 160-165 Hz frequency range,
which has been identified by experts as the minimum frequency range for the voice to be
identified as belonging to a female (Gelfer & Schofield, Spencer, 1988; Wolfe, Ratusnik,
Smith, & Northrop, 1990). Participant #2 (Group 1) presented with SFFs within this
range (Tables 5 and 6). At the end of the study, all (100%) of the participants presented
with SFFs above the 160-165 Hz frequency range. Tables 5, 6, and 7 illustrate the
quantitative results taken at the beginning and end of therapy for SFFs during reading and
conversation.

1. Voice Rating by Participants
At the beginning and end of the study, the participants were asked to rate how
masculine or feminine they perceived their voices to be on a scale of 1-7 (1 being a very
masculine voice and 7 being a very feminine voice). Upon completion of the study, all
participants presented with ratings that were higher than the ratings given by the
participants at the beginning of the study. Results are shown in Figure 11. Participants
1-3 are Group 1 (traditional voice therapy) participants and participants 4-6 are Group 2
(singing and MIT) participants. Table 8 shows pretest and posttest ratings by the
participants as well as the difference between those ratings.

2. Voice Rating by Judges
At the end of the study, four judges (two first-year speech-language pathology
graduate students and two non-trained volunteers) were asked to rate audio recordings of
both reading and conversation for each participant’s voice, pre- and post- voice therapy.
Figures 12-15 show the voice ratings given by the four judges pre- and post- voice
therapy. Judge #1 and #2 were first-year speech-language pathology graduate students
and judge #3 and #4 were random volunteers.

Case Studies
Case Study – Participant 1
Participant 1 (Group 1), age 63 years, had received previous voice therapy
training at the Speech and Hearing Center of the University of North Carolina at
Greensboro for two academic semesters. The participant was recruited for the study as a
volunteer from a transgender support group in Greensboro, North Carolina. Participant 1
had not undergone sexual reassignment surgery (SRS); however, she reported that she
has been receiving feminizing hormones. The participant had a musical background in
singing. She enjoyed singing during services at her local church as well as singing along
to recorded music. Participant 1 reported that on the male-to-female transition status, she
presented as 90% female and 10% male.
45
Quantitative Results:
At the beginning of the study, participant 1 presented with speaking fundamental
frequencies (SFFs) below the 160-165 Hz frequency range (156.31 Hz during reading
and 157.37 Hz during conversation), which have been identified by experts as the
minimum frequency range for the voice to be identified as belonging to a female (Gelfer
& Schofield, Spencer, 1988; Wolfe, Ratusnik, Smith, & Northrop, 1990). At the end of
the study participant 1 presented with SFFs above the 160-165 Hz frequency range
(209.99 Hz during reading and 234.11 Hz during conversation). Figure 16 shows the
participant’s SFF pre- and post- voice therapy.

Participant’s Overall Comments and Suggestions:
Participant 1 reported that she found the resonance exercises and the Real Time
Pitch (Kay Elemetrics) exercises to be the most helpful in helping with acquiring a
more feminine voice. She reported that she found the Real Time Pitch (Kay
Elemetrics) exercises to be helpful since she could visualize her pitch being in the
feminine range. Participant 1 also reported that she found the group aspect of therapy
to be beneficial since it allowed for positive reinforcement and peer feedback. Some
of the comments in the participant’s voice journal include reporting difficulties with
conversational speech vs. reading. She reported that that her “pitch drops” when she
has to think of what to say instead of reading the words and simply thinking of her
pitch and overall quality of her voice. Participant 1 had no suggestions for future
voice sessions.

Case Study – Participant 2
Participant 2 (Group 1), age 53 years, had not received previous voice therapy
training. The participant was recruited for the study as a volunteer from a transgender
support group in Greensboro, North Carolina. Participant 2 had not undergone sexual
reassignment surgery (SRS), and she had not been receiving feminizing hormones. The
participant did not have a musical background. Participant 2 reported that on the maleto-
female transition status, she presented as 100% female.
Quantitative Results:
At the beginning of the study, participant 2 presented with speaking fundamental
frequencies (SFFs) in the 160-165 Hz frequency range (165.72 Hz during reading and
160.89 Hz during conversation), which has been identified by experts as the minimum
frequency range for the voice to be identified as belonging to a female (Gelfer &
Schofield, Spencer, 1988; Wolfe, Ratusnik, Smith, & Northrop, 1990). At the end of the
study participant 2 presented with SFFs above the 160-165 Hz frequency range (189.50
Hz during reading and 179.09 Hz during conversation). Figure 17 shows the
participant’s SFF pre- and post- voice therapy.

comments in the participant’s voice journal include comments regarding difficulties with
pitch and pitch inflection when the conversation requires a “passionate speaking style” as
well as difficulties with maintaining forward resonance while speaking in long sentences.
Participant 1 had no suggestions for future voice sessions.
Case Study – Participant 3
Participant 3 (Group 1), age 37 years, had not received previous voice therapy
training. The participant was recruited for the study as a volunteer from a transgender
49
support group in Greensboro, North Carolina. Participant #3 had not undergone sexual
reassignment surgery (SRS); however, she reported that she had been receiving
feminizing hormones. The participant had a musical background. She reported playing
the harp on a professional basis. On the male-to-female transition status, participant 3
presented as 10% female and 90% male.
Quantitative Results:
At the beginning of the study, participant 3 presented with speaking fundamental
frequencies (SFFs) below the 160-165 Hz frequency range (86.13 Hz during reading and
87.44 Hz during conversation), which has been identified by experts as the minimum
frequency range for the voice to be identified as belonging to a female (Gelfer &
Schofield, Spencer, 1988; Wolfe, Ratusnik, Smith, & Northrop, 1990). At the end of the
study participant 3 presented with SFFs above the 160-165 Hz frequency range (204.86
Hz during reading and 193.48 Hz during conversation). Figure 18 shows the
participant’s SFF pre- and post- voice therapy.

Case Study – Participant 4
Participant 4 (Group 2), age 52 years, had received previous voice therapy
training at the Speech and Hearing Center of the University of North Carolina at
Greensboro for one academic semester. The participant was recruited for the study as a
volunteer from a transgender support group in Greensboro, North Carolina. Participant 4
had not undergone sexual reassignment surgery (SRS), and had not been receiving
feminizing hormones. The participant did not have a musical background. Participant 4
reported that on the male-to-female transition status, she presented as 70% female and
30% male.
Quantitative Results:
At the beginning of the study, participant 4 presented with speaking fundamental
frequencies (SFFs) below the 160-165 Hz frequency range (148.59 Hz during reading
and 149.31 Hz during conversation), which has been identified by experts as the
minimum frequency range for the voice to be identified as belonging to a female (Gelfer
& Schofield, Spencer, 1988; Wolfe, Ratusnik, Smith, & Northrop, 1990). At the end of
the study participant 4 presented with SFFs above the 160-165 Hz frequency range
(229.69 Hz during reading and 237.47 Hz during conversation). Figure 19 shows the
participant’s SFF pre- and post- voice therapy.

Case Study – Participant 5
Participant 5 (Group 2), age 62 years, had not received previous voice therapy
training. The participant was recruited for the study as a volunteer from a transgender
support group in Greensboro, North Carolina. The participant had undergone sexual
reassignment surgery (SRS) and reported that she had been receiving feminizing
hormones. The participant had a musical background in singing. She reported that she
enjoyed singing along to recorded music on a daily basis. On the male-to-female
transition status, participant 5 presented as 100% female.
Quantitative Results:
At the beginning of the study, participant 5 presented with speaking fundamental
frequencies (SFFs) below the 160-165 Hz frequency range (153.02 Hz during reading
and 156.11 Hz during conversation), which has been identified by experts as the

Some of the comments in the participant’s voice journal include reporting difficulties
with maintaining of frequencies at or above 160-165 Hz as well as with a legato vocal
pattern, identified as more female. A suggestion expressed by the participant was to
teach the participants a song with frequencies at or above 160-165 Hz so that the
participants would have a reference point for when they speak.
Case Study – Participant 6
Participant 6 (Group 2), age 52 years, had no previous voice therapy. The
participant was recruited for the study as a volunteer from a transgender support group in
Greensboro, North Carolina. Participant 6 was not on any hormones, and had not
undergone sexual reassignment surgery (SRS). Participant 6 had no musical background.
On the male-to-female transition status, participant 6 presented as 90% male and 10%
female.
Quantitative Results:
At the beginning of the study, participant 6 presented with speaking fundamental
frequencies (SFFs) below the 160-165 Hz frequency range (98.80 Hz during reading and
103.00 Hz during conversation), which has been identified by experts as the minimum
frequency range for the voice to be identified as belonging to a female (Gelfer &
56
Schofield, Spencer, 1988; Wolfe, Ratusnik, Smith, & Northrop, 1990). At the end of the
study participant 6 presented with SFFs above the 160-165 Hz frequency range (205.77

Participant’s Overall Comments and Suggestions:
Participant 6 reported that she found the resonance exercises and the Melodic
Intonation Therapy (MIT) exercises to be the most helpful in helping with acquiring a
more feminine voice. She also reported that she found the group aspect of therapy to be
beneficial since it allowed for peer feedback. A suggestion expressed by the participant
was to allow for participants to hear a playback of the their pre-test audio recordings
during the middle of the therapy program instead of only at the end in order for the
participants to compare their current voices to it and thus, gain some insight about
progress.

CHAPTER V
DISCUSSION
This study attempted to establish the effectiveness of singing exercises and Melodic
Intonation Therapy (MIT) in addition to traditional voice therapy approaches in creating a
more feminine sounding voice for male-to-female transgender individuals. In doing this,
both qualitative and quantitative measures, with an emphasis on qualitative, as well as
helpful aspects of therapy were used. Although this study was inconclusive, the
examiner as well as the participants of the study (Group 2) report that singing exercises
and Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) have been essential in aiding to create a more
feminine sounding voice. In general, this study was effective in aiding male-to-female
participants gain a more feminine sounding voice.
By the end of the study all six participants demonstrated Speaking Fundamental
Frequencies (SFFs) above the 160-165 Hz frequency range, which has been identified by
experts as the minimum frequency range for the voice to be identified as belonging to a
female (Gelfer & Schofield, Spencer, 1988; Wolfe, Ratusnik, Smith, & Northrop, 1990).
Further, all participants presented with self-voice ratings (1-7 scale) that were higher than
the ratings given by the participants at the beginning of the study (Figure 11). The voice
ratings given by the participants at the end of the study show that the participants’ self -
perceptions regarding the femininity of their voice were improved since the beginning of
the study. At the end of the study, four judges (two first-year speech-language pathology
59
graduate students and two random volunteers) were asked to rate each of the participant’s
voice pre- and post- voice therapy. All four judges rated the participants with voice
ratings that were above the ratings at the beginning of the study. An exception was noted
with participant #2 who presented with frequencies within the 160-165 Hz (frequency
range) from the beginning of the study. Little improvement was noted and thus, judges
rated the participant’s voice with none (3 judges) to limited (.5) (one judge)
improvements during voice ratings.
By the end of the study, Group 1 (participants receiving traditional voice therapy plus
language structures/vocabulary and nonverbal communication) presented with Speaking
Fundamental Frequencies (SFFs) above the 160-165 Hz range. Group 2 (participants
receiving traditional voice therapy plus singing exercises and MIT) performed at higher
SFFs by the end of the study; however, a significant difference between the two groups
was not present. Figure 10 shows the average improvement in SFFs between Group 1
and Group 2.
A number of individual parameters may have influenced the results of this study.
These include: Age of the participants, hormone therapy and surgery, previous voice
therapy, level on the gender transition status and musical experience.
1. Age
Participant #3 (Group 1) was the youngest participant in age (37 years old). The
participant demonstrated the highest gains in SFFs both during reading and conversation.
Age, however, may or may not be a contributing factor to the participant’s gains.
Another example is participant #1 (Group 1) who was the oldest of all participants (63
60
years old). The participant did not make the least gains in SFFs. Thus, age may or may
not have contributed to SFF gains.
2. Hormone Therapy and Surgery
The use of feminizing hormones and sexual reassignment surgery (SRS) do not
affect the vocal mechanism (Blaugrund, Isshiki, and Taira, 1992) and thus, they were not
expected to be predictors of success. Participant #5 (Group 2) was the only participant
considered post-op; however, she did not make the most gains in SFF. Participant #3
(Group 1) made the highest gains in SFF; however, she had not undergone SRS.
3. Previous voice therapy
Although this parameter was thought by the examiner to be a contributing factor
for higher gains in SFF, results did not show a correlation of previous voice therapy with
higher gains in SFF. Participant #1 (Group 1) and participant #4 (Group 2) had received
previous voice therapy; yet they did not make the highest gains in SFF. Participant #3
(Group 1) made the highest gains in SFF; however, she did not receive previous voice
therapy.
4. Level on the gender transition status
The degree to which an individual has transitioned to present as a female was also
thought by the examiner to be a contributing factor for higher gains in SFF. However, a
higher percentage level of femininity on the gender transition status did not necessarily
correlate with higher gains in SFF. For example, participant #3 (Group 1) who presented
with the highest gains in SFF by the end of the study reported only 10% femininity and
61
90% masculinity on the transition status. Participant #2 (Group 1) presented with 100%
female; however, the participant made the least gains in SFF.
5. Musical experience
Musical experience was thought of to be an important parameter in influencing
success with vocal femininity. According to experts, pitch variability or the musicality of
the voice pattern are essential to a feminine sounding voice (Andrews, 1999). Even
though results were inconclusive, participant #3 (Group 1), who presented with the
highest gains in SFF by the end of the study, reported playing the harp on a professional
basis.
Anecdotal Evidence
Anecdotal evidence shows that the participant who demonstrated the highest level of
improvement (#3-Group 1) also demonstrated the highest level of practice with the vocal
exercises. The participant also was the youngest (37 years old) of all the participants, had
previous musical experience and entered the program with the lowest fundamental
frequency level so there was more “room for improvement.”
Reading and Conversation
Differences were noted when comparing participants’ SFFs during reading and
during conversation (Tables 5 and 6). Participants reported having a preference for
reading or for conversation while speaking in a feminine manner. Participants who
preferred reading reported that they felt more comfortable with written material since
they did not have to think of what to say and thus, could concentrate on the femininity of
their speech. Participants who preferred conversation reported that they felt as if reading
62
was “constricting” since it did not allow for use of feminine language and free
expression. Participants #1 (Group 1), #4, and #5 (Group 2) presented with higher SFF
ratings during conversation and participants #2, #3 (Group 1), and #6 (Group 2)
presented with higher SFF ratings during reading. There is no evidence to support SFF
differences in reading and conversation by the current literature.
Ratings by Participants
Following therapy, all participants presented with self-voice ratings (1-7 scale)
that were higher than the ratings given by the participants at the beginning of the study
(Figure 11). Differences in improvement were greater for participants in Group 2
(traditional voice therapy plus singing and MIT) than in Group 1 (traditional voice
therapy) by one point. Participant #3 (Group 1) rated herself with the highest difference
in pre - and post - therapy voice ratings (3.5 points).
Ratings by Judges
Judges #1 and #2 were first year speech-language pathology graduate students
and judges #3 and #4 were non-trained volunteers. No significant differences in voice
ratings were noted between the two groups of judges. Judge #1 and #3 rated Group 1
(traditional voice therapy) and Group 2 (traditional voice therapy plus singing and MIT)
with equal ratings of improvement. Judges #2 and #4 noted greater improvements in
Group 2. Judge #2 noted an improvement of 2 points for Group 2 and judge #4 noted a
difference of 5 points for Group 2. Three out of four judges rated participant #2 (Group
1) as having no improvement and judge #4 noted a half (.5) point of improvement for
participant #2. Judges #1 and #3 rated participant #3 (Group 1) as having the greatest
63
improvement out of all participants whereas judge #2 rated participants #3 (Group 1) and
#5 (Group 2) as having the greatest improvement and judge #4 rated participant #6
(Group 2) as having the greatest improvement.
Most Helpful Aspects of Therapy
At the end of the study, the participants described aspects of therapy that were the
most helpful in acquiring a more feminine voice. All (100%) of the participants reported
that they found the group aspect of therapy to be very helpful since it provided for
opportunities for positive reinforcement and peer feedback.
All participants (100%) reported that they found the resonance exercises to be very
helpful in creating a “forward voice” and tone focus. Two (33.33%) participants reported
finding the feminine language exercises to be helpful and two (33.33%) reported finding
the Real Time Pitch (Kay Elemetrics) exercises to be helpful in acquiring a feminine
voice. Two (33.33%) participants reported finding the singing exercises to be helpful and
two (33.33%) reported finding the Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) exercises to be
helpful.
Least Helpful Aspects of Therapy and Suggestions
At the end of the study, the participants also described aspects of therapy that
were least helpful in acquiring a more feminine voice. All (100%) of the participants felt
that none of the therapy approaches chosen during therapy were “least helpful;” however,
they had a few suggestions for future sessions and/or participants. The main suggestions
expressed by the participants include the following:
64
• At the middle of the entire therapy program (around 6 weeks), the participants
should hear a playback of the their pre-therapy audio recordings in order for them
to compare their current voices to it and thus, gain some insight about progress.
• During the individual Real Time Pitch (Kay Elemetrics) activities, the participants
not working on the computer should practice other materials relevant to the
session.
• The principal investigator could teach the participants a song with frequencies at
or above 160-165 Hz so that the participants would have a reference point for
when they speak.
Implications for Future Research
Because there is lack of research addressing the voice treatment approaches for
male-to-female transgender individuals as well as a limited number of participants, it
would be helpful to replicate this study. In addition, the following design characteristics
should be considered:
• What is the Maximum Phonation Range (MPR)?
• What are the results at the middle of therapy (6 weeks)?
• What if songs were taught in addition to singing exercises? Would there
be more benefits seen in Group 2?
• What happens to male-to-female transgender individuals who receive
traditional voice therapy in combination with singing exercises and
Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) after the end of therapy? Can they
maintain their new feminine sounding voice in their daily lives better than
65
male-to-female transgender individuals who receive traditional voice
therapy alone?

APPENDIX A
DSM-IV & THE HARRY BENJAMIN’S INTERNATIONAL GENDER
DYSPHORIA ASSOCIATION
I. DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition)
1. Standards of Care for Gender Identity Disorders, Sixth Version
It should be noted that the American Psychiatric Association’s (2000) Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition - (DSM-IV) lists variations
in gender presentation as Gender Identity Disorders. The main gender variation
described under the category of Gender Identity Disorders is Gender Identity Disorder.
The following is a description of Gender Identity Disorder as it is presented in the DSMIV.
2. Gender Identity Disorder
Diagnostic Features
The DSM-IV describes Gender Identity Disorder as a strong and persistent crossgender
identification, which is the desire to be, or the insistence that one is, of the other
sex. This cross-gender identification must not merely be a desire for any perceived
cultural advantages of being the other sex but must also be persistent discomfort about
one’s assigned sex or a sense of inappropriateness in the gender role of that sex. The
diagnosis is not made if the individual has a concurrent physical intersex condition, such
as partial androgen insensitivity syndrome or congenital adrenal hyperplasia. To make
the diagnosis of Gender Identity Disorder there must be evidence of clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other significant areas of functioning.
75
Adults with Gender Identity Disorder are preoccupied with their wish to live as a
member of the other sex. This preoccupation may be manifested as an intense desire to
adopt the social role of the other sex or to acquire the physical appearance of the other
sex through hormonal or surgical manipulation. Adults with this disorder are
uncomfortable being regarded by others as, or functioning in society as, a member of
their designated sex. To varying degrees, they adopt the behavior, dress, and mannerisms
of the other sex. In private, these individuals may spend much time cross-dressed and
working on the appearance of being the other sex.
3. Associated Features and Disorders
Many individuals with Gender Identity Disorder become socially isolated. The
mental lives of some individuals revolve only around those activities that lessen gender
distress. They are often preoccupied with appearance, especially early in the transition to
living in the opposite sex role. Relationships with one or both parents also may be
seriously impaired. Some males with Gender Identity Disorder resort to self-treatment
with hormones and may very rarely perform their own castration or penectomy.
Especially in urban centers, some males with the disorder may engage in prostitution,
which places them at a high risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
Suicide attempts and substance-related disorders are commonly associated.
Children with Gender Identity Disorder may manifest coexisting Separation
Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and symptoms of depression.
Adolescents are particularly at risk for depression and suicidal ideation and suicide
attempts. In adults, anxiety and depressive symptoms may be present.
76
4. Physical Examination Findings and General Medical Conditions
Individuals with Gender Identity Disorder have normal genitalia in contrast to the
ambiguous genitalia found in physical intersex conditions. Adolescent and adult males
with Gender Identity Disorder may show breast enlargement resulting from hormone
ingestion, hair denuding from temporary or permanent epilation, and other physical
changes as a result of procedures such as rhinoplasty or thyroid cartilage shaving
(surgical reduction of the Adam’s apple). Distorted breasts or breast rashes may be seen
in females who wear breast binders. Post surgical complications in genetic females
include prominent chest wall scars, and in genetic males, vaginal strictures, rectovaginal
fistulas, urethral stenoses, and misdirected urinary streams. Adult females with Gender
Identity Disorder may have a higher-than-expected likelihood of polycystic ovarian
disease.
5. Specific Age and Gender Features
Females with Gender Identity Disorders generally experience less ostracism
because of cross-gender interests and may suffer less from peer-rejection, at least until
adolescence. In child clinic samples, boys with this disorder are referred for evaluation
more frequently than are girls. In adult clinic samples, men outnumber women by about
two or three times. In children, the referral bias toward males may partly reflect the
greater stigma that cross-gender behavior carries for boys than for girls.
77
II. The Harry Benjamin’s International Gender Dysphoria Association’s Standards
of Care for Gender Identity Disorders, Sixth Version
Harry Benjamin, M.D., (1885-1987) is best known in the field of sexology for his
unprecedented work with transvestites and transsexuals. His involvement in transvestism
and transsexualism was inspired by the work of Mangus Hirschfeld, a famous German
sexologist who in 1918 reported the first sex reassignment surgery having taken place in
Berlin in 1912 and who in 1923 coined the term transsexualism. Dr. Benjamin agreed
with Hirschfeld that transsexuals were a form of neurological intersex. He emerged
quickly as the American leader in the sexological field and in 1966 published the seminal
book The Transsexual Phenomenon. In his book Dr. Benjamin provided explanations
about transvestism, transsexualism, and homosexuality, sex and gender, possible
etiologies of transsexualism, surgical and nonsurgical management of transsexualism, as
well as legal aspects of transvestism and transsexualism.
In order to qualify for sex reassignment surgery (SRS) in the United States and
abroad, an individual must meet the standards of care established in 1979 by the Harry
Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA). These standards were
established to help professionals treating transsexuals to provide a minimum set of
guidelines to be met before clients proceed with hormone therapy, and, ultimately, sex
reassignment surgery. The standards of care (Brown & Rounsley, 1996) are as follows:
• The person must have been under the care of a therapist for at least one
year.
• The person must have been properly diagnosed as gender dysphoric.
78
• The person must have completed a real-life test by living in the opposite
gender for at least one year.
• The person must receive a written referral from her primary therapist and a
second referral from a clinician other than the therapist. At least one of
the two therapists must hold a PhD or MD.
• The person must be in good physical health.
The following is a description of the Standards of Care Introductory Concepts.
1. The Purpose of the Standards of Care
The major purpose of the SOC is to articulate a professional consensus about the
psychiatric, psychological, medical, and surgical management of gender identity
disorders.
2. The Overarching Treatment Goal
The general goal of psychotherapeutic, endocrine, or surgical therapy for persons
with gender identity disorders is lasting personal comfort with the gendered self in order
to maximize overall psychological well-being and self-fulfillment.
3. The Standards of Care are Clinical Guidelines
The SOC are intended to provide flexible directions for the treatment of persons
with gender identity disorders. When eligibility requirements are stated, they are meant
to be minimum requirements. Individual professionals and organized programs may
modify them. Clinical departures from these guidelines may co-occur because of a
patient’s unique anatomic, social, or psychological situation, an experienced
professional’s evolving method of handling a common situation, or a research protocol.
79
These departures should be recognized as such, explained to the patient, and documented
both for legal protection and so that the short and long term results can be retrieved to
help the field to evolve.
4. The Clinical Threshold
A clinical threshold is passed when concerns, uncertainties, and questions about
gender identity persist during a person’s development, become so intense as to seem to be
the most important aspect of a person’s life, or prevent the establishment of a relatively
unconflicted gender identity. The person’s struggles are then variously informally
referred to as a gender identity problem, gender dysphoria, a gender problem, a gender
concern, gender distress, gender conflict, or transsexualism. Such struggles are known to
occur from the preschool years to old age and have many alternate forms. These reflect
various degrees of personal dissatisfaction with sexual identity, sex, and gender
demarcating body characteristics, gender roles, gender identity, and the perceptions of
others. When dissatisfied individuals meet specified criteria in one of two official
nomenclatures - the Diagnostic and statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth
Edition (DSM-IV) or the International Classification of Diseases - 10 (ICD-10) -, they are
formally designated as suffering from a gender identity disorder. Some persons with
gender identity disorder exceed another threshold: They persistently possess a wish for
surgical transformation of their bodies.
80
5. Two Primary Populations with Gender Identity Disorder (GID) Exist - Biological
Males and Biological Females
The sex of a patient always is a significant factor in the management of GID.
Clinicians need to consider separately the biologic, social, psychological, and economic
factors of each sex. All patients, however, should follow the SOC.
81
APPENDIX B
TERMINOLOGY
According to Andrews, 1999, it is essential for helping professionals, such as
speech-language pathologists, psychologists, social workers, and counselors, to be
familiar with terminology used to describe variations in gender expressions. The
following descriptions are taken from Andrews, (1999):
Male/Female - Biological categories with membership assigned on the basis of criteria
such as chromosomal pattern and genitalia.
Masculinity/Femininity - Gender terms descriptive of qualities and characteristics that
are based on conventions prevalent in a particular society or culture. It is generally
believed that biological males may demonstrate some “feminine” qualities, and biological
females may exhibit some “masculine” traits.
Sexual Preference/Orientation - A construct not necessarily aligned with an
individual’s biological make-up or gender expression (Money, 1988). Sexual
preference/orientation is an individual’s desire to be sexually involved with a male or a
female.
Gender Expression - Refers to males expressing their femininity and females expressing
their masculinity as well as females expressing their femininity and males expressing
their masculinity.
Gender Presentation - Refers to gender expression as well as a strategy such as crossdressing
or use of gender props to aid in gender expression (Stevens, 1990).
82
Gender Dysphoria - This term connotes discomfort with one’s socially and culturally
assigned gender role.
Sexual Dysphoria - This term refers to discomfort with one’s biological make-up or sex.
Transvestite - The term describes men who like to dress in women’s clothing. It implies
a relationship between erotic desire and dressing.
Cross-Dresser - Refers to both males dressing as females and females dressing as males.
Describes gender presentation and is an inclusive term (i.e., it is used to refer to anyone
who cross-dresses for whatever reason and it is considered nonjudgmental). It is
estimated that 3 to 5% of heterosexual men in our society engage in cross-dressing
activities of some kind.
Drag - A vernacular term meaning “dressed as a girl.” It is predominantly a theatrical
term and suggests a showy, exotic, or high glamour image. Dressing in drag does not
signal a person’s sexual preference or inclination for full-time cross-dressing.
She-Male - Usually a gay male who lives full time as a woman or, in other words, a gay
transgenderist.
Female Impersonators/Impressionists - Professional entertainers who perform “in
drag.”
Transgenderist/Transgender - A broad term meaning that a person of one sex lives full
time in another gender role (cross-living).
Transsexual - This term denotes someone who feels that his or her gender identity is
fundamentally and irrevocably incompatible with his or her sexual or biological make-up.
83
Androgyne - This term derives from the Greek andro, meaning man, and gyne, meaning
woman. It is a sociological term meaning harmonious balance between the expression of
both masculine and feminine qualities within the same individual.
Hermaphrodite - A biological term indicating that physical characteristics of both sexes
are present in one individual.
84
APPENDIX C
BRIEF ANATOMY OF VOICE PRODUCTION
It is essential for speech-language pathologists working with transgender clients
as well as for the clients themselves to be familiar with anatomical terminology in order
to better treat the clients’ voice problem. The following descriptions are taken from
Seikel, King, & Drumright (2000).
Phonation - Also called voicing (sound produced by phonation), phonation is the product
of vibrating vocal folds within the larynx.
Larynx - The larynx is a musculo-cartilaginous structure located at the upper end of the
trachea, being comprised of the cricoid, thyroid, and epiglottis cartilages, as well as the
paired arytenoid, corniculate, and cuneiform cartilages. The larynx has two major
functions: 1) biological and 2) phonatory. In its biological function, the larynx protects
the airway from foreign materials during breathing and swallowing. In its phonatory
function, the larynx provides the vibratory power for speech. According to Swartz
(2004), linguistic (vocal stress, prosody, and intonation) and suprasegmental (pitch,
loudness, and resonance) properties and patterns of speech are also functions of the
larynx. These are complex functions that are mostly determined by the larynx’s posture,
tension, and airflow.
Vocal Folds - Otherwise referred to as vocal cords, these structures are located within the
airway at the superior end of the trachea. As the air stream passes between the adducted
vocal folds, they are made to vibrate. The vocal folds are composed of five layers of
tissue, with the deepest layer being muscle. On average, men have a 60% longer vocal
85
fold length than women, which accounts for the difference in fundamental frequency
between the sexes.
According to Jackson and Jackson (1937) the vocal folds have basically nine
different functions. These are as follows:
• Respiratory: this serves in regulating carbon dioxide in the blood.
• Valvular: a control that affects positive and negative pressure in the lungs;
these in turn have an effect on pulmonary circulation.
• Fixative: stabilizes the thorax for efficient arm movement.
• Protective: serves to prevent anything other than air from entering the air
passages.
• Deglutitory: closes off the airway so that no food or liquid can enter the
lungs when you swallow.
• Tussive: the coughing that repels foreign bodies and keeps them from
entering the larynx.
• Expectorative: clears the passage of secretions and inflammatory products
from below the glottis level. (In other words it clears your throat.)
• Emotional: creates reflexive sounds such as crying, laughing, moaning,
and so on. These sounds are considered phonatory, a continuous and even
vibrating of the vocal folds, unlike a cough.
• Phonatory: this is the voluntary use of sound as means of communication.
Respiration - Respiration is an essential process for voicing. Defined as the exchange of
gases between an organism and its environment, respiration is the process of inspiration
86
(breathing in) and expiration (breathing out). The rib cage, made up of the spinal column
and ribs, houses the lungs, which are the primary mechanisms of respiration. Air is
drawn into the lungs through muscular effort. The diaphragm contracts during
inspiration and as a result the lungs expand. Accessory muscles also provide added
expansion of the rib cage for further inspiration. Expiration, on the other hand, may
occur passively through the forces of tongue, elasticity, and gravity acting on the ribs and
rib cage.

APPENDIX J
DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING EXERCISES
According to Swartz (2004), it is important to use the diaphragm to breathe for many
reasons:
1. Ability to reach higher total lung volumes and inhalation of more air.
2. Support and control of air by the diaphragm reduces the need for laryngeal control
of airflow.
3. Improvement of relaxation of the larynx, since diaphragmatic breathing does not
involve active chest or clavicular movement.
Instructions:
1. Lie on your back.
2. Place a book on your diaphragm.
3. Place one hand on the book and one hand on your chest.
4. Raise the book as you breathe in without raising your chest.
98
APPENDIX K
GELFER’S STEPS IN VOICE THERAPY FOR TRANGENDER CLIENTS
(AJSLP, vol.8, p.201-208, August, 1999)
1. Selecting a target pitch (160-165 Hz)
• Client produces various frequencies on the syllable /ma/
• Client attempts a higher pitch on /ma/ (higher than 165 Hz)
• Clinician models a 5-note ascending scale (do, re, mi, fa, sol) on /ma/ for client to
model beginning at E3 (165 Hz): then at F3 (175 Hz) and 1 more semitone
upward if client is successful; then select the semitone on which the client has
greatest upward movement with good quality as the target pitch.
2. Habituating the target pitch in syllables
• Client practices producing the target pitch on a variety of /m/ -initiated CV
syllables lasting 2 to 3 seconds each
• Client practices strings of 2 to 5 /m/ -initiated syllables using breath support and
correct breathing patterns.
• Client continues vocal flexibility exercises by producing the ascending 5 note
scale on the syllable /ma/, beginning on the target pitch level. A combination
ascending-descending scale can also be tried.
3. Words: Chanting and Speech Intonation
• Clinician introduces “chanted” words first (/m/ -initiated) using a pitch pipe and a
vocal model, and chant a stimulus word at client’s target pitch. The client should
99
imitate with the same flat Visi-Pitch trace as the clinician. The client should be
successful at chanting a list of words before the next step.
• Clinician models same words using a slightly exaggerated rising-falling
intonation pattern, prolonging the initial /m/ at the target pitch, then raising her
pitch 1 semitone, and then dropping her pitch to one semitone below the target as
she ends the word. The Visi-Pitch should show this upward-downward
movement. The client should follow the same procedure. If she has poor breath
quality, she is reminded to take a good breath first and to allow the highest part of
the intonation contour to become more breathy.
• Clinician introduces other phonemic contexts (first words beginning with /n, w, j,
l, r/, then voiced fricatives, affricates, and stops) and then alter the level of
propositionality (e.g., by reading word lists, then moving to activities with more
linguistic formulation, such as filling in missing words of a sentence or answering
questions with single word responses). Practice single words that client uses
frequently, e.g., hello, bye, OK, yes, no.
4. Phrases
• Clinician models /m/ -initiated words at the beginning of each phrase; then go to
other voiced continuants /n, w, j, r/ to initiate phrases; continue to use Visi-Pitch
feedback; after the client reads phrases until she maintains the targeted pitch and
acceptable voice quality, increased propositionality by using a partial phrase
client repeats and completes or asking client questions that can be answered with
a phrase.
100
• Clinician increases focus on intonation, discouraging a monotone pattern and
excessive pitch shifts, concentrating on naturalness of variability. Providing
context to the client regarding the motivation behind the utterance can facilitate
naturalness.
• Clinician moves to functional communication skills as soon as possible by
practicing phrases used frequently in the home or work. Once these phrases can
be said easily in her feminine voice, with good quality and intonation, they can be
used at home or work for carry-over.
5. Sentences
• At this level address pitch, quality, intonation, and pitch range. The client is
expected to control these areas and the clinician monitors, paying special attention
to ensure that declarative sentences end with falling intonations more often than
rising intonations. The approximate pitch range is approximately 140-300 Hz.
• As the client becomes more confident and capable at the sentence level, the use of
the Visi-Pitch is faded.
• Sentences should express happiness, sorrow, annoyance, anger, and other
emotions so the client can experiment with such expressions using her feminine
voice.
• Clinician increases propositionality just as you did at the phrase level. You can
present partial sentences for client to repeat in complete form, several related
words for client to make up a sentence about, single or unrelated to serve as the
101
topic of a sentence, picture descriptions, responses to questions and role-playing
activities.
• Clients may have difficulty paying attention to what they are trying to say as well
as how they are saying it. You will spend a lot of time at this level of increased
propositionality.
102
APPENDIX L
VOWEL PROLONGATION EXERCISES
Instructions: Read the following sentences and prolong the underlined vowels.

Now blend the words in these longer sentences.
1. At what time should I arrive?
2. The equator is an imaginary circle around the earth.
3. Equilibrium is a state of balanced adjustment.
4. If you are an actor, you are almost always anxious.
5. Use another exit if you are expecting excess traffic.
105
APPENDIX N
BREATHINESS EXERCISES
Research shows that some women speak with incomplete closure of the vocal
folds, something which produces breathiness and which is viewed as normal for women,
but far less likely to occur in men (Biever, & Bless, 1989; Sodersten, Hertegard, &
Hammarberg, 1995). According to Klatt, & Klatt, 1990; Sulter, & Peters, 1996, female
voices are perceived as breathy more often than male voices.
Instructions: Read the following words and sentences with excess airflow, especially on
words beginning with /h/.
List of Words:
1. Hello
2. Happy
3. Heart
4. Home
5. High
6. Heels
7. Health
8. Humor
9. Harmony
10. Humidity
106
List of Sentences:
1. Hello, how are you?
2. How marvelous of you to do that!
3. Humor is healthy.
4. Haven’t we met before?
5. Her hair is so beautiful!
6. I love to wear high heels!
7. Home is where the heart is.
8. Have a very happy birthday!
9. Have you been married before?
10. Halloween is my favorite holiday.
107
APPENDIX O
RESONANCE EXERCISES
The exercises given below are used to establish the optimal pitch level and the
proper tone focus (Cooper, 1973).
1. Key word and number exercises:
• Say “um-hum one, um-hum two” to ten, with the number on the same pitch level
as the “um-hum.” Matching the pitch level of the number to the “um-hum” is
more difficult than might be expected. The “um-hum” said with the mouth closed
utilizes the natural tone focus; the number said with the mouth opened reverts to
the old habitual pitch level, which the patient must avoid.
• Say “nim-nim one, nim-nim two” to ten, again matching the “nim-nim” and the
number in pitch and tone focus.
• Use “me-me one, me-me two” to ten, as above.
2. After the key word and number exercises, the next step is to carry over the pitch level
and tone focus into phrases or brief sentences.
• Have the client say, “me-me one, how are you?” “Me-me two, I’m fine.” “Me-me
three, what time is it?” “Me-me four, who said that?” The client uses any phrases
he/she wishes, as well as any key word, such as “me-me” or “nim-nim.”
Combining the key word and number exercises with the phrase gives the client a
reference point to transfer the pitch and tone focus to longer sentences.
108
• The client says the key word with the phrase, eliminating the number, such as
“Me-me, I feel fine.” “Me-me, it is nice today.” Again, any key word may be
used, but the key word then remains the same throughout the exercise. Any
phrase or brief sentence may be used.
• The client continues the above exercise, switching to another key word. If he/she
used “me-me,” he/she may now change to “nim-nim” or “hello.” The key words
have different vowel sounds, and thus, afford practice on various vowels and a
carry-over of the pitch and tone focus from one vowel to another.
3. The client next practices longer sentences. He/she again says the key word prior to
reading the sentence. He/she uses the same key word for a series of sentences and then
changes to a new key word for the next group of sentences.
4. The client speaks spontaneously in sentences, saying a key word before, during, or
after each sentence.
5. The client reads aloud from magazines with the pitch and tone focus being monitored
by the patient and the therapist.
6. The client talks spontaneously to the therapist, who routinely reminds the client if the
pitch and tone focus are incorrect.
7. The client has been attempting since the beginning of therapy to use the new pitch
level in the therapy session and outside the therapy session. The final step is a carry-over
of the correct pitch level and tone focus in all situations.
Note: The key words, especially “um-hum,” may be used in all situations as a reminder
of the proper pitch level and tone focus. This word is said spontaneously as if the client
109
were acknowledging a comment or agreeing with what was said. Since the “um-hum” is
socially acceptable, it can be used unobtrusively in conversation as a therapeutic
maneuver.
110
APPENDIX P
LANGUAGE STRUCTURES AND VOCABULARY EXERCISES
I. Underlying Goals of Communication
1. Men use conversation mostly as a means of exchanging factual information. They
like to maintain control over the topic of conversation.
2. Women focus more on the importance of relationships. They use conversation as a
means of getting information as well as establishing rapport. Women usually convey
more details and feelings than men.
II. Indirect Communicative Strategies
1. Women tend to use language differently than men to meet their needs. Often, women
use questions to express their needs in an indirect way. Some examples include:
• “Are you hungry?” rather than “I’d like something to eat.”
• “Are you hot?” rather than “I’d like to turn down the heat.”
III. Tentative Language and Inclusive Pronouns
1. Women use tentative language, words of uncertainty in everyday conversational
speech. Some examples include:
• “I think I want a dress like the one in the window.”
• “May be I’ll come with you to the store.”
2. Inclusive pronouns are often present in feminine language structure. Some examples
include:
• “You should come to the luncheon with us.”
111
• “We love going to the park.”
IV. Tag Questions
1. Tag questions are used to maintain a conversation and to show interest in what the
speaker is saying. Some examples include:
• “It’s lovely, isn’t it?”
• “You’ll come, won’t you?”
V. Increased Elaboration, Adjectives, and Adverbs
1. Increased elaboration, adjectives, and adverbs are often present in feminine language
structure. Some examples include:
• “My parents have an attractive, two-story, red brick house.”
• “Their new puppy is all black, energetic, and absolutely adorable.”
VI. Increased Use of Apologies and Socially Polite Words
1. Increased use of apologies, and socially polite words are often present in feminine
language structure. Some examples include:
• “I’m sorry to hear that.”
• “Thank you so much!”
VII. Vocabulary Differences
1. Men are less descriptive and more concise than women. Some examples of
vocabulary used by men include: “let’s eat,” “blue,” “fast,” etc.
112
2. Women are more descriptive and they elaborate frequently. Some examples of
vocabulary used by women include: “gorgeous,” “wonderful,” “turquoise blue,” etc.
113
APPENDIX Q
NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION EXERCISES
Nonverbal communication includes every component of communication other
than words themselves. Nonverbal behaviors include visual cues, such as appearances
and gestures, and environmental factors, such as use of space and body position. All of
these aspects affect messages conveyed through communication. Following is a list of
stereotypically observed nonverbal behaviors that differ between men and women:
• Women tend to express their emotions more openly (e.g., laughing, crying).
• Women tend to exhibit more listening/attending behaviors during conversation
(e.g., eye contact and head nodding).
• Women tend to use more gestures and movements to emphasize their statements.
• Women tend to touch themselves (e.g., playing with a necklace, tugging at
earrings, playing with their hair).
• Women also tend to touch their conversational partners to express support,
affection, agreement, and comfort.
• Women tend to move their heads while speaking and while listening to their
conversational partner.
• Women tend to sit more closely to their conversational partners.
• Women tend to use a wide range of facial expressions to convey their emotions.
• Women tend to stand in an “S-Shape” form while men tend to stand in an “AShape”
form.
114
APPENDIX R
POSTTEST INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
1. On a scale from 1 to 7, 1 being a very masculine voice and 7 being a very feminine
voice, rate your voice as it is now.
2. Which aspects of therapy do you think have helped you the most in acquiring a
more feminine voice and manners?
3. Which aspects of therapy do you think have helped you the least in acquiring a
more feminine sounding voice and manners?
4. Do you think that you have benefited from the group aspect of therapy? If yes,
how? If not, why not?
5. What overall suggestions and/or comments would you like to make that you
believe would help improve the voice therapy sessions?
115
APPENDIX S
THE RAINBOW PASSAGE
When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act like a prism and form a
rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take
the shape of a long, round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently
beyond the horizon.
